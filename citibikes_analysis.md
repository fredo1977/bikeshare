#NYC Citi Bike Analysis

This is a summary of the analytic work that i did with the NYC Citi Bike data to visualize the utilization of bike-sharing program. 

##Questions
After completing a visualization of the bike-sharing users in a large city of NYC, we will compare how a city such as Des Moines will succeed in bike-sharing program as well. We will utilize data from the census from Des Moines (QuickFacts)

#Population
According to the census in July 2018, the population of New York City (NYC) was 8,398,748. Compared to Des Moines, the population in 2018 was 204,183. NYC had a growth in population 2.7% and Des Moines had a 6.2% growth. 

#Age
The breakdown of Age groups in respective cities goes as follows:

NYC:                    Des Moines:
Under 5 - 6.5%          6.9%
Under 18 - 20.9%        24.5%
65 and Over - 14.1%     11.7%

Age is an important factor as we have visualized in Age by Trip, showing that there is a high spike in trips people born in 1969 and 1989. 

##Summary
In the city of NYC we were able to determine and visualize that 58.5% of the population is the target market; ages from 19-64. Per the 2018 census data, Des Moines has a similar age group at 56.9% being their popultion. With the presented data, were are able to confidently recommend that a bike-sharing program would indeed be successful in the city of Des Moines, Iowa.
